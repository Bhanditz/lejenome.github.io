First, this is a series of notes from my day to day Linux experiences. I will
just write them as a fallback notes when I setup a new Linux box and to share
them with anyone interested. This is the first note and I'm not sure how much
others notes I will wrote, well maybe this is the first and last one ;). They
are related with ArchLinux packages settings and file locations, If you are
using an other distro, don't ask me where to find a specific file or any other
distro related question, it just needs a lite effort to find them. OK, let's
begin...

I was using polipo before switching to squid, It worked just fine but it miss
HTTPS caching support. Install squid
